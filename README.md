- **Interacting Tables:**
  - `results`
  - `resultsTriggerAudit`
- **Description:** The `afterInsertResultsTrigger` is an AFTER INSERT trigger that activates whenever a new record is inserted into the `results` table. When triggered, it copies the details of the new result (including `result_id`, `race_id`, `driver_id`, `team_id`, `position`, and `points`) into the `resultsTriggerAudit` table. Additionally, it logs the type of DML operation ('INSERT'), the current date and time (`ChangeDate`), and the user who made the change (`UserChange`). This trigger ensures that all new results entries are recorded for audit purposes, providing a detailed log of all race results additions.

```SQL
Insert data into Results to trigger the audit
INSERT INTO results (race_id, driver_id, team_id, position, points) VALUES
(1, 1, 1, 1, 25),
(1, 2, 1, 2, 18),
(2, 3, 2, 1, 25),
